                <p> Leadership in business is the capacity of a company's management to set and achieve challenging goals, take fast and decisive action when needed, outperform the competition, and inspire others to perform at the highest level they can.
                It can be difficult to place a value on leadership or other qualitative aspects of a company, versus quantitative metrics that are commonly tracked and much easier to compare between companies. Leadership can also speak to a more holistic approach, as in the tone a company's management sets or the culture of the company that management establishes. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leadership.asp#:~:text=Leaders%20act%20in%20line%20with,others'%20success%20in%20the%20company.&text=Leaders%20find%20answers%20to%20challenges,an%20efficient%20and%20effective%20manner.">Click for more Leadership information</a></p>
